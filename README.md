# -Coding-Practice-Tracker

This repository helps me stay consistent with coding during the semester. It includes:

- A terminal-friendly tracker (`coding_tracker.txt`)
- Python practice files (e.g., MoodMate features)
- C++ refresher projects (e.g., game logic and tools)

I update this weekly to maintain my skills and build confidence.
